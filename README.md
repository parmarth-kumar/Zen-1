# üöÄ Space Biology Knowledge Engine

Welcome to the Space Biology Knowledge Engine, a web application designed to explore, search, and analyze decades of NASA's space biology research. This project was built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**.

Our engine transforms a simple CSV list of publications into a rich, interactive, and AI-summarized database, making complex scientific discoveries more accessible to researchers, students, and enthusiasts alike.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **AI-Powered Summaries:** Leverages the Google Gemini AI to read research papers and generate concise, easy-to-understand summaries, categories, and keywords.
  * **Robust Data Pipeline:** A powerful Node.js script uses a headless browser (Puppeteer) to reliably scrape publication data, processes it with AI, and builds a rich JSON database from a simple CSV source.
  * **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Instantly search through hundreds of publications by title or keyword, and filter by specific research categories.
  * **Thematic UI:** A beautiful, responsive interface with a custom-animated "space biology" background, available in both light and dark themes.
  * **Detailed Research View:** Click on any research card to open a detailed modal with the AI summary and a direct link to the full publication on the NCBI website.
  * **Resilient Data Processing:** The data generation script is built to be robust, featuring automatic retries, batch processing, and an API key pool to manage rate limits.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or higher recommended)
  * `npm` (comes with Node.js)
  * Google Account(s) to generate Gemini API keys.

### 1\. Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parmarth-kumar/Zen-1.git
cd Zen-1
```

Install the required `npm` packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2\. Configuration (API Keys)

This project requires API keys from Google AI to power the data generation script.

1.  **Generate API Keys:** Have each team member go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and create a free API key.

2.  **Create `.env` file:** In the root of the project, create a file named `.env`.

3.  **Add Keys:** Open the `.env` file and add your keys as a comma-separated list.

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEYS=key_from_person_1,key_from_person_2,key_from_person_3
    ```

### 3\. Data Generation

The application's data is generated by a script that reads the `SB_publication_PMC.csv` file and processes it with AI. **You only need to do this once.**

1.  **Run the Script:** In your terminal, run the script. It will process one batch of articles.
    ```bash
    node scripts/generate-dataset.js
    ```
2.  **Repeat:** Run the same command again. The script will automatically pick up where it left off.
      * **Note:** This script is slow but reliable as it uses a real browser. You will need to run it repeatedly over several sessions to process all 600+ articles due to API rate limits.

The final data will be saved in `src/data/ai-generated-data.json`.

### 4\. Running the Application

Once the data generation is complete, you can run the web application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
